This is a sample tower of hanoi game. Start with 5tiles.
Use 2 space separated integers to move tiles from one peg to another.
i.e. 1 2 will move a tile from peg no 1 to peg no 2.
Possible integer values are 1 2 and 3
NOTE: inputs other than integers is likely to crash the program.

I have compiled it using minGW and Code Blocks IDE. Only hanoi_game_WIN.cpp was built.
In linux a smiple terminal command like:

g++ hanoi_game.cpp hanoi.cpp -o hanoi_game

should compile the sample game.
